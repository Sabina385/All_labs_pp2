Programming is the process of creating programs (software). To do this, programmers write source code in one of the programming languages.

There are more than 300 programming languages, but you can choose from ten of the most popular ones for a successful career. It would be even more correct to first determine the field in which you are going to work, and only then proceed to choosing a language.

One of the best languages for beginners is Python. This popular general-purpose language is good for its conciseness and simplicity of syntax, and it is actively used by IT companies around the world.
